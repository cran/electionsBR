legend_fed(
  year,
  uf = "all",
  br_archive = FALSE,
  ascii = FALSE,
  encoding = "latin1",
  export = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Election year. For this function, only the years 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018
are available.}

\item{uf}{Federation Unit acronym (\code{character vector}).}

\item{br_archive}{In the TSE's data repository, some results can be obtained for the whole country by loading a single
within a single file by setting this argument to \code{TRUE} (may not work in for some elections and, in 
other, it recoverns only electoral data for presidential elections, absent in other files).}

\item{ascii}{(\code{logical}). Should the text be transformed from Latin-1 to ASCII format?}

\item{encoding}{Data original encoding (defaults to 'Latin-1'). This can be changed to avoid errors
when \code{ascii = TRUE}.}

\item{export}{(\code{logical}). Should the downloaded data be saved in .dta and .sav in the current directory?}

\item{temp}{(\code{logical}). If \code{TRUE}, keep the temporary compressed file for future use (recommended)}
}
\value{
\code{legend_fed()} returns a \code{data.frame} with the following variables:

\code{legend_fed()} downloads and aggregates the data on the party denomination (coalitions or parties) from the federal elections in Brazil,
disaggregated bi cities. The function returns a \code{data.frame} where each observation
corresponds to a city.
