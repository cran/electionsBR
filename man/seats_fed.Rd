\title{Download data on the number of seats under dispute in federal elections}
\usage{
seats_fed(year, uf = "all", br_archive = FALSE, ascii = FALSE,
  encoding = "latin1", export = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Election year. For this function, only the years of 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016
are available.}

\item{uf}{Federation Unit acronym (\code{character} vector).}

\item{br_archive}{In the TSE's data repository, some results can be obtained for the whole country by loading a single
within a single file by setting this argument to \code{TRUE} (may not work in for some elections and, in 
other, it recoverns only electoral data for presidential elections, absent in other files).}

\item{ascii}{(\code{logical}). Should the text be transformed from Latin-1 to ASCII format?}

\item{encoding}{Data original encoding (defaults to 'Latin-1'). This can be changed to avoid errors
when \code{ascii = TRUE}.}

\item{export}{(\code{logical}). Should the downloaded data be saved in .dta and .sav in the current directory?}
}
\value{
\code{seats_fed()} returns a \code{data.frame} with the following variables:

\itemize{
  \item DATA_GERACAO: Generation date of the file (when the data was collected).
  \item HORA_GERACAO: Generation time of the file (when the data was collected), Brasilia Time.
  \item ANO_ELEICAO: Election year.
  \item DESCRICAO_ELEICAO: Description of the election.
  \item SIGLA_UF: Units of the Federation's acronym in which occurred the election.
