\arguments{
\item{year}{Election year. For this function, only the years 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014

\item{uf}{Federation Unit acronym (\code{character vector}). Defaults to \code{'AC'} (Acre).}

\item{ascii}{(\code{logical}). Should the text be transformed from Latin-1 to ASCII format?}

\item{encoding}{Data original encoding (defaults to 'Latin-1'). This can be changed to avoid errors
when \code{ascii = TRUE}.}

\item{export}{(\code{logical}). Should the downloaded data be saved in .dta and .sav in the current directory?}

\item{temp}{(\code{logical}). If \code{TRUE}, keep the temporary compressed file for future use (recommended)}

corresponds to an electoral section in a given Brazilian state.

 files in the working directory.
